Enhancing Preclinical Dental Education through the Integration of Virtual Reality through HTC Vive on Desktop and Haply Inverse 3 Haptic Devices


Introduction & Background
Practical teaching in preclinical dental education requires extensive knowledge of dental sciences,
educational methodologies, assessment practices, and motor skill acquisition, providing students with
essential knowledge and skills before transitioning to clinical practice (Mushtaq & Mon-Williams, 2021).
Preclinical dental education is crucial in training dental professionals by providing them with a foundation
in dental procedures and techniques before working on patients. In many dental institutions, preclinical
dental education relies heavily on traditional teaching methods such as lectures, textbooks, and hands-on
practice manikins/ typodonts. These typodonts significantly differ from an actual patient because they
lack autonomous movement and speech ability. While these approaches have been practical to some
extent, they often lack the realism and interactivity required to fully prepare students for the clinical setting
(Mossey et al., 2001). The advent of advanced technologies, including Virtual Reality (VR) and haptics,
has opened new frontiers in preclinical dental education, offering unprecedented opportunities for
enhancing the teaching and learning of essential dental procedures.

Virtual Reality (VR) is an advanced computer graphics system that generates a simulated reality or
environment. It can deceive the human mind into perceiving it as authentic, transporting users to various
contexts and providing unique learning experiences (McLellan, 1996). Haptics is a technology that
transmits tactile information using sensations such as vibration, touch, and force feedback (Dorr et al.,
2022), thereby providing authentic learning experiences. Virtual Reality (VR) and haptics have emerged
as promising tools to supplement traditional teaching methods, providing a more immersive and
interactive learning experience where learners can visualize complex anatomical structures and dental
procedures in a three-dimensional space, facilitating a deeper understanding of spatial relationships and
procedural dynamics (Saghiri et al., 2022). Additionally, haptic virtual reality simulators provide users
with a unique tactile experience through the use of handheld devices that provide input through auditory
cues, applied pressure, and vibrational sensations (Wang et al., 2019). This combination aims to bridge
gap between theory and practice and addresses various learning styles, enhancing the educational
experience.

Integrating VR and haptic technologies into preclinical dental education signifies a pivotal shift towards
more immersive and interactive learning methodologies (Towers et al., 2019). This shift is particularly
relevant for acquiring complex procedural skills such as hand scaling, a cornerstone of dental hygiene,
and periodontal treatment, which require a high degree of tactile sensitivity and fine motor control.
Traditionally constrained by the limitations of manikin-based practice and theoretical learning, the
teaching of hand scaling has been ripe for innovation (Wu et al., 2023).

The potential benefits of integrating VR and haptics into preclinical dental education are manifold. Studies
have indicated that such technologies can significantly improve learning outcomes, including enhanced
spatial awareness, procedural confidence, and psychomotor skills (Moussa et al., 2022). Furthermore, the
ability to simulate various clinical scenarios, including rare and complex cases, ensures that students are
well-prepared for the challenges they will face in their clinical years and beyond. The convergence of
these technologies offers a comprehensive learning platform that can mimic a wide range of dental
procedures, from essential examinations to more complex surgical interventions. This allows for repeated
practice without the constraints and ethical considerations associated with using live patients or cadaveric
materials (Dhopte & Bagde, 2023). However, the implementation of these technologies comes with its set
of challenges, such as the high cost of equipment, the need for specialized training for both students and
faculty teaching staff and the integration of these technologies into existing curricula in a manner that
complements traditional teaching methods rather than replacing them (Wu et al., 2023).

Problem statement
Current pre-clinical training in the Bachelor of Oral Health programme relies largely on using simulated
contexts and self-directed or subjective experiences whereby students rely on their sense of perception and
depth when performing standard clinical techniques such as hand scaling. Integrating Virtual Reality and
haptic technologies into preclinical dental education is essential to address the shortcomings of traditional
teaching methods highlighted above. VR with haptic technologies offer a more inclusive learning approach,
a more thorough hands-on experience practiced in a more authentic, immersive, and realistic environment
that closely mimics what students will experience when they consult live patients. VR and haptics can
increase personalized support and provide authentic contexts for effective learning by closely mimicking the
scaling technique in a live patient with the benefits of technological feedback alongside supervisor guidance.
However, there is a paucity of published evidence in the literature highlighting successful pedagogical
approaches to incorporating VR and haptic technologies in preclinical dental education. Even less published
literature has been reported on student and staff experiences, challenges, attitudes, and perceptions regarding
introducing these technologies into pre-clinical training programmes at dental training institutions. Currently,
no published literature provides successful integration of VR and Haptic Technologies into the pre-clinical
training for oral hygiene students in a developing country, context or setting.

Rationale for the study
Integrating Virtual Reality and haptic technologies into preclinical dental education is essential to address the
shortcomings of traditional teaching methods. These new technologies offer a more inclusive learning
approach, a more thorough hands-on experience practiced in a more authentic, immersive, and realistic
environment that closely mimics what students will experience when they consult live patients. By
incorporating VR and haptic technologies into mainstream pre-clinical training platforms, this research seeks
to enhance the preclinical experience in dental education by addressing critical shortcomings in the current
teaching and training approaches. Using virtual reality technology, realistic dental procedures such as hand
scaling can be practiced on simulators within a digital environment to cultivate critical competencies, thereby
connecting theory and practice. The learning process can be enhanced by delivering personalized and
adaptable learning experiences sensitive to the diverse BOH student cohort. This pedagogical approach can
thus enhance the effectiveness of dental education and promote equity by catering to differential learning
styles and increasing the availability of high-quality training in the BOH preclinical skill training. Utilizing
these technologies, the study aims to enhance dental education to match current educational methods and
technological progress, ultimately cultivating more skilled and self-assured dental professionals in
preparation for patient care demands.
